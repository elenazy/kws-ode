# KWS-ODE: Neural ODE for small-footprint keyword spotting

KWS-ODE is a neural network using [neural ordinary differential equation (Neural ODE)](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq) with temporal convolutional neural network (TCNN) [[2]](#Reference) and time delay neural network (TDNN) [[3]](#Reference). The implementation of KWS-ODE is based on [Honk](https://github.com/castorini/honk).
